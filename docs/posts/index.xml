			<description>Recently, a friend and I were discussing blindness. We talked about it for a while, and concluded that we can&amp;rsquo;t understand it.
That explanation probably seemed totally insufficient, so I just need you to close your eyes for a moment. What do you see? Now, if you said nothing, you aren&amp;rsquo;t wrong (unless, of course, you are truly blind&amp;hellip; but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain how you&amp;rsquo;re reading this. Wait, you&amp;rsquo;re probably listening&amp;hellip; Nevermind.</description>

<p>That explanation probably seemed totally insufficient, so I just need you to close your eyes for a moment. What do you see? Now, if you said nothing, you aren&rsquo;t wrong (unless, of course, you are truly blind&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t explain how you&rsquo;re reading this. Wait, you&rsquo;re probably listening&hellip; Nevermind.) but you aren&rsquo;t exactly right either.</p>

<p>You might see black, which is nothing, but the real problem here is that you are <em>seeing</em> things in first place. A testamony to this is standing under a bright light, or pushing on your eyelids. I don&rsquo;t recomend this, but you probably have done it any ways. When you do these things you end up seeing <em>something</em>, gren spots, orange eyelids, etc. To truly not see anything would mean not even having the ability to look at your eyelids, completly disconnecting even your perception of sight.</p>
