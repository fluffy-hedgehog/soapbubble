Recently, a friend and I were discussing blindness. We talked about it for a while, and concluded that we can't understand it.

That explanation probably seemed totally insufficient, so I just need you to close your eyes for a moment. What do you see? Now, if you said nothing, you aren't wrong (unless, of course, you are truly blind... but that doesn't explain how you're reading this. Wait, you're probably listening... Nevermind.) but you aren't exactly right either. 

You might see black, which is nothing, but the real problem here is that you are *seeing* things in first place. A testamony to this is standing under a bright light, or pushing on your eyelids. I don't recomend this, but you probably have done it any ways. When you do these things you end up seeing *something*, gren spots, orange eyelids, etc. To truly not see anything would mean not even having the ability to look at your eyelids, completly disconnecting even your perception of sight.
